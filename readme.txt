lane zero is kind of the far left lane,lane one is the middle lane, and lane two is the right lane
I just kind of want to go as close to the speed limit as possible, so I'm doing 49.5.

I kind of want to use these sparsely spaced waypoints.

keep track of my reference state.It's either going to be where the car is at or it's going to be at this previous path's endpoint.
So I defined this reference x, y and yaw.
